            <p class="sectionSubTag text-small">Education is the process of facilitating learning, or the acquisition of
                knowledge, skills, values, beliefs, and habits. Educational methods include teaching, training,
                storytelling, discussion and directed research. Education frequently takes place under the guidance of
                educators, however learners can also educate themselves. Education can take place in formal or informal
                settings and any experience that has a formative effect on the way one thinks, feels, or acts may be
                considered educational. The methodology of teaching is called pedagogy.

                Formal education is commonly divided formally into such stages as preschool or kindergarten, primary
                school, secondary school and then college, university, or apprenticeship.</p>

            <p class="sectionSubTag text-small">There is a wide gender disparity in the literacy rate in India:
                effective literacy rates (age 7 and above) in 2020 is 84.7% for men and 70.3% for women.[6] The low
                female literacy rate has a dramatically negative impact on family planning and population stabillisation
                efforts in India. Studies have indicated that female literacy is a strong predictor of the use of
                contraception among married Indian couples, even when women do not otherwise have economic
                independence.[7] The census provided a positive indication that growth in female literacy rates (11.8%)
                was substantially faster than in male literacy rates (6.9%) in the 2001â€“2011 decadal period, which means
                the gender gap appears to be narrowing.[8]</p>

            <p class="sectionTag text-big">The future of primary education in India.</p>
            <p class="sectionSubTag text-small">Education began in prehistory, as adults trained the young in the
                knowledge and skills deemed necessary in their society. In pre-literate societies, this was achieved
                orally and through imitation. Story-telling passed knowledge, values, and skills from one generation to
                the next. As cultures began to extend their knowledge beyond skills that could be readily learned
                through imitation, formal education developed. Schools existed in Egypt at the time of the Middle
                Kingdom.[2]


                Matteo Ricci (left) and Xu Guangqi (right) in the Chinese edition of Euclid's Elements published in 1607
                Plato founded the Academy in Athens, the first institution of higher learning in Europe.[3] The city of
                Alexandria in Egypt, established in 330 BCE, became the successor to Athens as the intellectual cradle
                of Ancient Greece.</p>
